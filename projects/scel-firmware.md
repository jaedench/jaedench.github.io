The Smart Campus Energy Lab (SCEL) is a Vertically Integreated Project (VIP) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. SCEL's primary goal is to collect meteorological data using weatherboxes to help predict weather patterns. With this data, ideal spots for renewable energy sources may be determined and installed in the future. Renewable energy has become as important as ever since it is a cleaner alternative to fossil fuel. Specifically in Hawaii, the government has set a goal to be 100% renewable by 2045. The SCEL lab currently has two hardware teams, Team Apple and Team Guava, one firmware team, and one machine learning team. 

As the Firmware Team, our job is to maintain and improve the weatherbox code, while troubleshooting issues the hardware teams are having. In the fall semester of 2022, the Firmware Team worked on the server, gateway, and database while also working with the hardware team to troubleshoot their connectivity issues. Towards the end of the semester, the Firmware Team began researching and implementing the simplified data pipeline. To implement the code, we used SQL and the command line to create the database and C to make changes to the weatherbox schemas.
