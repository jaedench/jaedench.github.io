## UHM Dating
<i>Contributors<i>: Jaeden Chang, Elis Diep, and Reid Lum

## Overview
<i>The Problem:<i> Many UH students are single and ready to mingle, but there is no easy way for them to find others that also want to mingle. Dating apps may threaten the safety of UH students because meeting people outside of UH can be dangerous.

<i>The Solution:<i> UHM dating will provide a place for students to create a profile and tailor it to their personality and characteristics. Students can add their favorite food, activities, majors, and other interests. Students can review candidates and get in contact with each other!

## Mockup page ideas
Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles filtered by specific tastes, capabilities, and goals to find compatible people to contact.

Students can also set up notifications to find out automatically when a profile is created that satisfies the characteristics that they specify.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, and create new categories of interests based on the profiles.

Some mockup pages include:
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>User home page</li>
<li>Admin home page</li>
<li>User profile page</li>
<li>Browse users by interests and personality traits</li>

## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
<li>
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, and sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works? To remedy this, have a tutorial page or a tutorial on the landing page)
</li>
<li>
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, and edits site.
</li>
<li>
User goes to landing page, logs in, finds people with compatible interests, and contacts them.
</li>

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

<li>Set up meeting times using a calendar</li>
<li>Set up meeting location on campus using a map</li>
<li>Add reviews on peopleâ€™s profiles</li>
